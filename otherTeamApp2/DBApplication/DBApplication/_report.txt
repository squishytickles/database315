Group 26

I: Simply paste the csv files you want imported into the database
   in to the root directory, and add their filenames into the 
   inputFileList file.  Then, the program will automatically load
   them on launch, and name each table with the name of the file.

To use, run the program and select one of the options there.

II: It was simple enough to load in tables with their functions in      
    the DLL, and also simple to run queries and present the results.
    This group's database was extremely well documented and easy
    to use.

III: We were able to use all aspects of this database system, and we
     were not held back by any aspects of the provided database.
